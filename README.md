## Plans

- Auto find active carrot
- Instance hopper
    - `/och instance 54` (Or something like this), Then it keeps leaving and joining until you get into that instance
    - Only if I find a more reliable Instance ID

## Known issues

- Treasure hunter gets stuck on the last chest
- Treasure hunter doesn't communicate to an average player what chest # it is on, and how many spots it is checking
- Instance ID, lmao
- Users who can't read
